# mice_protein_classification
The aim is to identify subsets of proteins that are discriminant between the classes. . I report two different classification model, the Random Forest and Decision Tree modelling of thee expression levels of proteins critical to learning in some mice for the given mouse model of Down Syndrome in which the proteins were responsible in producing detectable signals in the nuclear fraction of the cortex. This work exhibits the performance evaluation for various Random Forest and Decision Tree configurations by choosing optimum hyper parameters and best fit features to built the best model with highest accuracy without overfitting or underfitting the model and hence comparing the classification accuracy for both the models. The Random Forest derived entails 100 trees in the forest with 21 selected features to yield the maximum accuracy.
